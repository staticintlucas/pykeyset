# Change Log

## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/staticintlucas/pykeyset/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

### New

* Use [keyset-rs](staticintlucas/keyset-rs) as the backend

### Changes

* Drop Python 3.6 support
* Support parsing TTF and OTF font files instead of our own XML format.
* Remove support for the old XML font and icon formats.
  A TTF/OTF font (which can contain icon outlines) should be used instead
* Change profile format to map from KLE font sizes to actual font sizes/margins.
  This means the `[legend.alpha]`, `[legend.symbol]`, and `[legend.mod]` should be replaced with
  `[legend.5]`, `[legend.4]`, and `[legend.3]`, respectively
* Replace `homing.bump.radius` with `homing.bump.diameter` in profile files
* Remove key top gradients as they weren't very pretty

### Built in resources

* Profiles: `cherry`, `kat`

* Support exporting PNG, PDF, and AI (experimental) files

### Changes
