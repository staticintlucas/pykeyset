## Warning

<b>This project is currently in the early stages of development.
It currently supports exactly what I need for TA Origins, and not much else.
You may run into various bugs and crashes as there are currently only a few unit tests ðŸ˜„.
In future I hope to stabilise this project and add more extensive support for different
profiles, fonts, file formats, etc.</b>

Feel free to help this project improve by opening bug reports, feature requests, etc;
or contributing directly to the code by opening a pull request.

## Example usage

`pykeyset` uses commands to tell it what to do.
Commands can be given on the command line,
but the easiest way is to create a *`.cmdlist`* (command list) file.
Each line of the command list is a command for pykeyset to execute.

For example, a file called *`example.cmdlist`* contains the following commands:

    load kle http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/102f1fb614275f50e39d970d691e1030
    load profile cherry
    load font cherry
    generate layout
    save svg example.svg

To execute the command list run:

    pykeyset example.cmdlist

The output in *`example.svg`* is:

![example.svg](example/example.png)

## Python API

Currently you *can* use `pykeyset` directly as a Python module,
but as it is still in early development the API will probably change a lot until a 0.1 release.
After that there will be a more stable API, so you don't need to mess around with *.cmdlist* files
if you're familiar with Python.

## Installation

`pykeyset` is available on [PyPI]. To install with `pip` run:

    pip install pykeyset

Or to install the latest source directly from GitHub, run:

    git clone https://github.com/staticintlucas/pykeyset.git pykeyset
    cd pykeyset
    pip install .

This project uses [Poetry] as it's dependency manager and build system.
To install this package locally for development, run:

    poetry install

To build the source distribution and wheel run:

    poetry build

## Contributing

`pykeyset` uses [Black] for formatting, and all code must pass [Flake8]'s checks.
These are checked by GitHub on all pull requests.
To run these tools automatically when committing,
install the [pre-commit] hook in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`].
